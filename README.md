## Predicting Stock Mark

This repository contains code that can be used to predict stock market based on the Toronto Exchange Stock dataset.

While there are a number of existing example datasets for predicting stock market, based on the quality of the data we decided to use the [Toronto Exchange Stock](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/0e1e57aa-e664-41b5-a69f-d814d4407d62) dataset, we wanted to see if we could produce an accurate prediction on this dataset. 

Created for Agile Project Management for Machine Learning at George Brown College.
